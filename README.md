Lessons learned

Where Go shines:

Typing system allows writing everything in a single pass, with quite high
confidence that it will just work.

Where Go fails:

- Processing collections of data is cumbersome. This might change with
  generics.

- Value-oriented makes in-place data manipulation unintuitive,  for someone
  used to Java or Python. You set a value and it doesn't change. A specifics of
  a language that one needs to get used to.
